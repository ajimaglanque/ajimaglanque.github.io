								<h3>to greater heights</h3>

								<p><b>Heyyy. 😁 </b>You know how I (<strike>hate</strike>) don't like goodbyes, right? 😂</p>

								<p>But this isn't a goodbye. I refuse to call it one. We're stubborn like that. =)) This is just the digital version so you can access it anytime if you don't have the box with you. Just make sure you have internet though. :))</p>

								<p>To say that I'm blessed meeting you in Awana would definitely be an understatement. I never expected the Lord to give me a best friend that I never knew I needed—not until you came. You've opened and touched parts of my heart that I didn't know existed, and you've helped me heal in more ways than you'll ever know.</p>

								<p>I'm sorry that I can't come quickly and work with you fully in my favorite ministry. 🥺 But I know and I'm sure that we'll go beyond Awana, beyond the walls of Acacia, kase sure ako na 'yung friendship natin is one of the awesomest things God has ever created. 👌</p>

								<p>You may be having a hard time owning some of what they have to say here about you, but the reality is that <b>you have been a great blessing</b> to many and no one can take that away from them and from you. You did well, Kleng. 🤗</p>

								<p>It doesn't end here. In my eyes, you still shine as brightly as you did the first time that I've truly seen and known you. Keep on shining for Jesus by sharing His light to others. Every day I'm grateful for you at forever akong magiging proud sa'yo and of the fact na ikaw 'yung best friend ko. 😊<br/><b><i>I love you and I'll always be here for you.</i></b> 🤗</p>

										<p><b>Awana SEA Ministry Assistant / Canva Adviser</b><br/>Dearest Mikah,</p>

										<p>"I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now." Philippians 1:3-5</p>

										<p>This is my prayer to you as you continue on your next steps. I am very blessed to have worked with you, to have seen you grow, and to have added a new friend. I enjoyed every bit and I apologize for times I was not my best. I thank God that at the time I needed friends in a new work place, God blessed me with you! Yes, it is hard to say goodbye (for now), but I cannot hold you back from what God has in store. I will miss our chats and emails, but I hope you do get the rest you need may you hear and heed where the Lord calls you.</p>

										<p>Thank you for being patient and understanding. Thank you for the great and excellent work that you do. I don't say it often, but you have done a great job! I will miss all the Canva moments and all the in betweens that made it special.</p>

										<p>You will be entering an unknown territory, but always remember God knows your future and has the best plans for you. I will be here to pray with you and syempre okay din ako with chikka and hopefully, when possible, to still have time to catch-up over coffee or milktea or anything. For the fears and worries you have, may God be your comfort and guide. Never lose sight of Him.</p>

										<p>Please know that I am here for you. Feel free to message me (though you know I don't reply right away :P ). I am here to listen and pray with you.</p>

										<p>Muli, maraming maraming maraming salamat. You are a blessing to me and many others. Keep on and and keep moving forward!</p>

										<p>Love,<br/>💛 Ate Dotty</p>

										<h2><a>Rose Ann Grace Garga</a></h2>

										<p><b>Finance Officer</b><br/>Mikah has been a blessing to Awana because she's ready to accept tasks even if it is not her forte like she's a teacher by profession but became an office admin staff. She's ready to extend her time to listen to your story even if it's like puppy love thing 😂🤣 And she's always ready to walk and cook with you 😊</p>

										<p>I pray for your new chapter in life with Ptr. Criswell. May you be faithful in serving our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the new mission field He has called you. As Philippians 1:6 says, "For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</p>

										<h2><a>Ptr. Chris Juloya</a></h2>

										<p><b>Curriculum Developer</b><br/>Mikah has been a blessing to me since I started working at Awana. From the beginning of the hiring process until actual start at work, she was very helpful. If there's one thing that I would never forget about her and has sticked with me is how her heart is really for the younger generation. She cares for them so much and it really encourages me to see other people's love for others, a sincere love and care specifically for the youth.</p>

										<p>I pray that you do not seek the hidden will of God asking "what is God's will for me" because He has revealed that to us, through Christ, the Law and the Gospel. He also has given us skills and rationale to think and assess, with the resources and opportunities that we have, to identify where can you best glorify God.</p>

										<p>And as someone who will marry a pastor, do not think of yourself to be limited to being a 'pastor's wife', for contrary to what many believe, there is no such thing. Just because your husband is a pastor, you too are to be in ministry. No, you are to be a wife, a neighbor and sister, that glorifies God. That includes supporting your husband's ministry in ways that would glorify Him, and that is not limited to being in full-time ministry. Yes there are advantages to being full-time in ministry, but remember, your ministry and responsibility is to God by doing what's best for your family. The shepherding of the church is given to its elders, not to the wife of the pastor. May that remove a weight and pressure upon you. You are not to act as a 'standard pastor's wife', you are to act and behave as a servant of God, to live by loving God "with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might (Deut 6:5) and to "love your neighbor as yourself" (Lev 19:18).</p>

										<p>Remember, the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever (Westminster Shorter Catechism Q&A1), so aim to do that in whatever situation you are in, as an individual or as a wife, with total reliance on God's sovereignty. As Paul says, whatever you do...do all for the glory of God, live in "Coram Deo", 'before the face of God'. 🙂 </p>
